This repository contains the results of the manuscript entitled: Embedded Restricted Boltzmann Machine Approach for Adjustments of Repetitive Physical Exercises Using IMU Data

An a modified vesion of the PHYTMO data set from: Villa, Sara & Jiménez Martín, Ana & García, Juan. (2022). A database of physical therapy exercises with variability of execution collected by wearable sensors. Scientific Data. 9. 10.1038/s41597-022-01387-2. (https://zenodo.org/record/6319979)
This dataset version convert the raw IMU data to a Manitude metric for the Accelerometer and Gyroscope.
